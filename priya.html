<div> greate the lot of friends 
    By using "lots of friends" you just intensify the expression "a lot of friends".
    Someone can say "I have many friends" and he could intensify this by saying 
      "I have many, many friends". But both expressions are used so often that they 
      are almost interchangeable and the intensifying force of "lots of" has become weak
